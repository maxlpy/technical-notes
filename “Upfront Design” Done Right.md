## “Upfront Design” Done Right

Am I exaggerating? You bet I am, but my experience has shown to me that if the team does no upfront design, they are very likely to make these mistakes. I have seen this happen over and over again, and the odds are that you have seen this too.

That is why I think that we can benefit from the upfront architecture design, but we should not overdo it. We must remember that the goal of the “old fashioned” upfront design is to find the only way to solve the customer’s problem. We don’t need this kind of upfront design.

We need upfront design that does not tie our hands. We need upfront design that helps us to keep our options open as long as possible and doesn’t prevent us from changing things that we don’t get right at the first time.

It is hard to find the balance between the “old fashioned” upfront design and no design, but it is definitely possible. We can get started by following these five rules:

* We should know our tools. If a certain problem is often solved in the same way, there is probably a good reason for that. That is why we should consider using that method as well.
* We should avoid best practices that aren’t helping us to do a better job. Common sense is the most important tool of a software developer, and we should always remember to use it.
* Before we write any code, we should design how we handle the cross cutting concerns such as error handling, validation, transactions, and security. We should also have a rough idea about the architecture of our application, but we should not carve it in stone. It is just a sketch and we will (or we should) update it when we learn more about the customer’s problem.
* When we implement a single feature, we should do the simplest thing that could possibly work. After we have written the code, we must evaluate the consequences of our decisions. If our changes have a negative effect to the architecture of our application, we must refactor or rewrite our code. This is a favor that we must do to the developers who maintain our application after we have moved on.
* We must ensure that every member of our team is an architect. If all team members are allowed to participate to the architecture design, they are more likely to follow the common guidelines because they helped us to create them.
